Introduction to Real-Time FireWire
=========================
RT-FireWire is an OpenSource project, aimed at using FireWire as fieldbus connection in industrial automation.
The software stack is based on RTAI (an real-time extension to Linux). Currently, driver layer of the stack supports OHCI-compliant adapters. On the transaction layer, the stack
implements IEEE1394 transaction protocol in deterministic way.

Due to the IEEE1394 protocol, each FireWire node potentially hosts 48-bits wide address space, which gives a big room to let other high-level 
communication protocols stack on, e.g. CANopen, Real-Time Publish-Subscribe protocol, etc. The stacking of high-level protocols can be 
abstracted as: 

1.	allocating certain range of address space (not necessarily maaped to physical memory). 
2.	implementing at least one handler for the transactions on that certain address space, e.g. read, write or lock. 
3.	implementing handlers to take care of adding and removing of local bus adapters and bus reset. 

Work of the RT-FireWire stack was originally developed by Zhang Yuchen in his MSc assignment at Control Engineering Group, 
University of Twente, the Netherlands. Currently, he is still working on the finishing phase of his assignment. Meanwhile, he is also
responsible to managing the RT-FireWire project and maintaining this website.

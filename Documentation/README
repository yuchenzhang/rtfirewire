RT-FireWire README
============
1.	Basic Introduction
RT-FireWire is an OpenSource project, being aimed at developing software to use FireWire as
new generation, yet high performance serial fieldbus in distributed control field. 

2.	Modules after compiling
After running configure --with-rtai=/your rtai-installed location, make, and make install. 
You can find all the modules in /usr/local/rt-firewire/modules by default setting, or the place your specified. 
The modules are: rtskbuff, rt_serv, rtpc, rt_ohci1394, rt_ieee1394, bis1394. You must insmod the first 3 modules
first, becasue they are offering basic real-time services to other three modules, which is FireWire specific. 

3.	Creating Char device
In case the char device /dev/rt-firewire is not created automatically, you can create it manually, by 
mknod /dev/rt-firewire c 10 241. 

4.	First play-around
After inmoding all the modules, you can run hostconfig now to see all your FireWire adapters, quite similiar
to ifconfig on Ethernet. 
for example:
===========
hostconfig -a 
===========
This gives a view of all local hosts. 

If you have 2 machines, you can run rtping to test the latency between request and response. 
for example: 
=======================
rtping -h fwhost0 -d 0 -s 500. 
=======================
This does a test between local host "fwhost0" and remote node with id 0. 
If the id of local host is used, then it is a loopback test. 

More update will follow! And enjoy your first flame:)

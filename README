                             RT-FireWire Version 0.2.1
                             ===================

What is it?
-----------
RT-FireWire is an OpenSource project, being aimed at developing software to use 
FireWire as new generation, yet high performance serial fieldbus in distributed 
control field. 

Current RT-FireWire supports OHCI-compliant FireWire adapters. 


What are the requirements?
--------------------------
- Linux kernel 2.6.x
  Linux kernel 2.4.x
- Xenomai 2.0 or better
- OHCI-compliant adapter


How to install it?
------------------
1. Install and test a suitable real-time Linux version
2. cd to a preferred directory (e.g. /usr/src)
3. tar xvjf <PATH-TO-RTNET-ARCHIVE>/rtfirewire-X.X.X.tar.bz2
4. cd rtfirewire
5. for Xenomai 2.0  ./configure --with-linux=<PATH_TO_REAL_TIME_PATCHED_LINUX> --with-rtext=<PATH_TO_XENOMAI_INSTALLATION>
   for Xenomai 2.1 or better ./configure --with-linux=<PATH_TO_REAL_TIME_PATCHED_LINUX> --with-rtext_config=<PATH_TO_CONFIG_OF_XENOMAI_INSTALLATION>
   for example, if you have Xenomai-2.1 installed in /usr/xenomai and real-time linux code in /home/username/linux-2.6.14-xeno2.1,the configure command line would be something like: ./configure --with-linux=/home/username/linux-2.6.14-xeno2.1 --with-rtext-config=/usr/xenomai/bin/xeno-config
6. make
7. make install
   This will create the directories <PREFIX>/sbin with all configuration tools,
   <PREFIX>/modules containing all core modules, <PREFIX>/include with the
   required API header files.
8. run "mknod /dev/rt-firewire c 10 241" on your target system to create the
   configuration interface device node.


How to test it?
---------------
After inmoding all the modules, you can run hostconfig now to see all your FireWire adapters, quite similiar
to ifconfig on Ethernet. 

for example: hostconfig -a 

This gives a view of all local hosts. 

If you have 2 machines, you can run rtping to test the latency between request and response. 

for example:  rtping -h fwhost0 -d 0 -s 500. 

This does a test between local host "fwhost0" and remote node with id 0. 
If the id of local host is used, then it is a loopback test. Use rtping -h for more help.
